{"id": 12, "question": "What is a loss function and how is it used in training?", "answer": "A loss function measures the difference between the model’s prediction and the actual target value. During training, the model attempts to minimize this loss using optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam. Common loss functions include cross-entropy for classification and mean squared error for regression."}
{"id": 13, "question": "What is stochastic gradient descent (SGD)?", "answer": "SGD is an optimization technique that updates the model weights incremen- tally using a small subset (mini-batch) of training data. This makes it more efficient and scalable for large datasets, although it introduces more noise into the learning process compared to full-batch gradient descent."}
{"id": 14, "question": "What are some common regularization techniques?", "answer": "Regularization methods like L1/L2 penalties, dropout, and data augmentation help prevent overfitting by discouraging complex or overly sensitive models. These techniques encourage the model to generalize better to unseen data. 9 1. Foundations of Deep Learning and Neural Networks"}
{"id": 15, "question": "What is dropout and how does it help?", "answer": "Dropout is a regularization technique where a random subset of neurons is turned off during each training iteration. This prevents co-adaptation of neu- rons and forces the network to learn redundant, more robust features."}
{"id": 16, "question": "How is data preprocessing done for neural networks?", "answer": "Preprocessing typically includes normalization or standardization, encoding categorical variables, tokenization for text, and resizing or augmenting images. Proper preprocessing ensures that the model receives consistent and meaningful input data."}
{"id": 17, "question": "What is batch normalization and why is it used?", "answer": "Batch normalization standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch, which stabilizes learning and allows for higher learning rates.

{"id": 21, "question": "What is the transformer architecture?", "answer": "The transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in the paper “At- tention is All You Need” by Vaswani et al. (2017). It is designed to process sequential data while overcoming the limitations of recurrent models. The transformer uses self-attention mechanisms to model dependencies between to- kens in a sequence, allowing it to process data in parallel, unlike RNNs."}
{"id": 22, "question": "What is self-attention in transformers?", "answer": "Self-attention is a mechanism that allows each token in a sequence to attend to every other token, including itself. It helps the model weigh the importance of different tokens when encoding information. This is particularly useful for capturing contextual relationships, suchaslong-rangedependencies, withintext or other sequential inputs."}
{"id": 23, "question": "What are queries, keys, and values in self-attention?", "answer": "In self-attention, each token is projected into three vectors: the query, key, and value. Attention weights are calculated by comparing the query with keys of all tokens using dot products. These weights are then applied to the value vectors to produce the attention output. This allows the model to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input."}
{"id": 24, "question": "How does multi-head attention improve model performance?", "answer": "13 2. Introduction to Transformers Multi-head attention runs several self-attention mechanisms in parallel, each with different learned projections. This allows the model to capture different types of relationships in various subspaces and improves its ability to under- stand complex patterns in the input data."}
{"id": 25, "question": "What is positional encoding and why is it needed?", "answer": "Transformers lack inherent order-awareness since they do not use recurrence. Positional encoding injects information about the relative or absolute position of tokens into their embeddings. These encodings help the model understand the sequence structure and maintain the order of input tokens."}
{"id": 26, "question": "What are sinusoidal positional encodings?", "answer": "Sinusoidal positional encodings use sine and cosine functions of varying frequencies to encode position information. These encodings are fixed and allow the model to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training, due to their mathematical properties."}
{"id": 27, "question": "What is the encoder-decoder structure in transformers?", "answer": "The encoder-decoder structure consists of two main parts. The encoder pro- cesses the input sequence and generates contextual representations, while the decoder takes this encoded information and produces the output sequence. This setup is ideal for tasks like machine translation, where the input and output are different sequences."}
{"id": 28, "question": "How many layers are typically in a transformer?", "answer": "Transformers typically consist of multiple stacked layers—often 6 to 12 in the base versions, and up to 96 in large models like GPT-4. Each layer contains a multi-head attention block and a feed-forward neural network, both followed by normalization and residual connections."}
{"id": 29, "question": "Why do transformers use residual connections?", "answer": "Residual connections allow the model to bypass certain layers during training 14 200 Questions About Transfer Learning and Transformers by adding the input of a layer to its output. This helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, facilitates training of deep networks, and improves conver- gence."}
{"id": 30, "question": "What is layer normalization and why is it used?", "answer": "Layer normalization stabilizes the training process by normalizing the inputs across features. It ensures consistent signal propagation through the layers and helpsmaintainnumericalstability,especiallyindeepnetworksliketransformers."}
{"id": 31, "question": "What kind of feed-forward networks are used in transformers?", "answer": "Transformers use position-wise feed-forward networks composed of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. These networks are ap- plied independently to each position and increase the model’s capacity to learn complex transformations."}
{"id": 32, "question": "How is masking used in transformers?", "answer": "Masking is used in transformers to prevent information leakage. In the encoder, padding masks prevent the model from attending to non-informative tokens. In the decoder, causal masks ensure that predictions for a given time step don’t use information from future tokens."}
{"id": 33, "question": "How do transformers handle sequence-to-sequence tasks like trans- lation?", "answer": "In sequence-to-sequence tasks, the input is encoded into context vectors by the encoder. The decoder then generates the output sequence one token at a time, attending both to the previously generated tokens and to the encoder outputs. This structure enables accurate translation, summarization, and other generative tasks."}
{"id": 34, "question": "What advantages do transformers have over RNNs and LSTMs?", "answer": "Transformers process entire sequences in parallel, allowing for much faster training. They also capture long-range dependencies better than RNNs or LSTMs, 15 2. Introduction to Transformers which struggle with vanishing gradients over long sequences. Additionally, transformers are more scalable and flexible."}
{"id": 35, "question": "Why are transformers more parallelizable than RNNs?", "answer": "RNNs require sequential processing, where each token depends on the previous one. In contrast, transformers use self-attention to relate all tokens simultane- ously, enabling parallel computation across entire sequences, which significantly reduces training time."}
{"id": 36, "question": "What are some applications of transformers beyond NLP?", "answer": "Transformers have been successfully applied to computer vision (Vision Trans- formers), audioprocessing, proteinfolding(AlphaFold), andevenreinforcement learning. Their ability to model sequence and structure makes them broadly useful across domains."}
{"id": 37, "question": "Whatisthedifference betweenencoder-onlyanddecoder-only trans- formers?", "answer": "Encoder-only models (e.g., BERT) are used for understanding tasks like classifi- cation,whiledecoder-onlymodels(e.g.,GPT)areusedforgeneration. Encoder- decoder models (e.g., T5, BART) support tasks like translation or summariza- tion that require both input understanding and output generation."}
{"id": 38, "question": "How is attention computed efficiently in transformers?", "answer": "Attention is computed using matrix multiplications of query, key, and value vectors, enabling the use of GPUs for fast, parallel computation. Variants like sparse attention or Linformer reduce the quadratic complexity of attention for longer sequences."}
{"id": 39, "question": "How are embeddings used in transformers?", "answer": "Transformers use learned embeddings to represent input tokens as dense vectors. Theseembeddingsarecombinedwithpositionalencodingstomaintainsequence information, forming the model’s input. 16 200 Questions About Transfer Learning and Transformers"}

It is pretrained using tasks like Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), making it particularly effective for tasks requiring contextual understanding."}
{"id": 42, "question": "What is GPT and how does it differ from BERT?", "answer": "GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), developed by OpenAI, is a decoder- only transformer architecture designed for text generation. Unlike BERT, GPT is unidirectional and autoregressive, meaning it predicts the next word in a se- quence given all previous words. It is trained using causal language modeling, making it powerful for tasks like text completion, story generation, and conver- sational agents."}
{"id": 43, "question": "What are the key features of the T5 model?", "answer": "T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) reframes every NLP task as a text- to-text problem.

It also incor- porates segment recurrence and relative positional encoding, making it more effective for tasks involving long sequences."}
{"id": 45, "question": "What improvements does RoBERTa make over BERT?", "answer": "RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) builds on BERT by remov- ing the Next Sentence Prediction objective, training on more data with longer sequences, and using dynamic masking. These changes result in better down- stream task performance and more robust contextual representations."}
{"id": 46, "question": "What are Vision Transformers (ViT)?", "answer": "Vision Transformers adapt the transformer architecture for image classification tasks. Instead of using convolutional layers like CNNs, ViT divides an image into fixed-size patches, flattens them, and processes them as a sequence. The self-attention mechanism helps capture spatial relationships, enabling ViT to achieve competitive results on large-scale vision benchmarks."}
{"id": 47, "question": "How are image patches encoded in Vision Transformers?", "answer": "In ViT, an image is divided into non-overlapping patches (e.g., 16x16 pix- els), which are then flattened and linearly projected into embeddings. These patch embeddings, along with learnable positional encodings, are fed into the transformer, allowing it to process the image similarly to how text tokens are processed."}

{"id": 61, "question": "What is transfer learning in machine learning?", "answer": "Transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is reused or adapted for another, related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, transfer learning allows knowledge gained from a large source dataset to be appliedtoatargetdomain, typicallywithlimiteddata. Thisapproachimproves training efficiency and often leads to better performance on the target task."}
{"id": 62, "question": "How does transfer learning relate to deep learning models?", "answer": "Deep learning models often require large amounts of data to learn useful rep- resentations. Transfer learning addresses this by allowing models trained on large datasets like ImageNet or C4 to be fine-tuned on smaller domain-specific datasets. The early layers learn general features, while later layers can be ad- justed to fit specific tasks."}
{"id": 63, "question": "What is pretraining in transfer learning?", "answer": "Pretraining is the process of training a model on a large, general-purpose dataset to learn broad representations. In transformers, pretraining typically involves tasks like masked language modeling (BERT) or autoregressive predic- tion (GPT). These pretrained models are then adapted to more specific tasks through fine-tuning."}
{"id": 64, "question": "What is fine-tuning in transfer learning?", "answer": "25 4. Transfer Learning Basics Fine-tuning involves taking a pretrained model and continuing its training on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This phase adjusts the weights slightly to specialize the model for a particular domain or objective. Fine-tuning usually uses a lower learning rate and fewer epochs to avoid overwriting the pretrained knowledge."}
{"id": 65, "question": "What is the difference between feature-based and task-specific trans- fer learning?", "answer": "In feature-based transfer, the pretrained model is used as a fixed feature extrac- tor, and only a classifier or decoder is trained on top. In task-specific transfer, the entire model (or most of it) is fine-tuned on the new task. The latter usually yields better performance but requires more computation."}
{"id": 66, "question": "What is zero-shot learning?", "answer": "Zero-shot learning refers to the ability of a model to perform a task without being explicitly trained on any examples from that task. In transformers, this is often achieved by prompting a model with instructions or examples from unrelated tasks, relying on its general knowledge learned during pretraining."}
{"id": 67, "question": "What is few-shot learning?", "answer": "Few-shot learning involves teaching a model to perform a task using only a small number of examples. Large language models like GPT-3 can perform few-shot tasks using in-context learning, where examples are provided directly in the prompt rather than through gradient-based training."}
{"id": 68, "question": "How does prompt-based learning work in transformers?", "answer": "Prompt-based learning reformulates tasks into natural language prompts that guide a model’s response. For example, instead of fine-tuning a classifier, one might prompt a model with \"The sentiment of the review is:\" followed by the text.

{"id": 76, "question": "How do large language models enable transfer learning at scale?", "answer": "Large language models like GPT-4 or PaLM are pretrained on massive corpora and can generalize to a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. Their sheer scale and rich representations allow them to perform well in zero- shot and few-shot settings."}
{"id": 77, "question": "What are frozen models in transfer learning?", "answer": "In some transfer learning approaches, the pretrained model is kept \"frozen,\" meaning its weights are not updated during fine-tuning. Only a classifier head or adapter module is trained on the target task. This reduces computational cost and avoids overfitting."}
{"id": 78, "question": "What are adapter layers in transfer learning?", "answer": "Adapter layers are lightweight modules inserted into a pretrained model to learn task-specific information. They allow fine-tuning without updating the main model weights, making it easier to train models on multiple tasks while maintaining efficiency."}

{"id": 101, "question": "What is the role of attention in transformer models?", "answer": "Attention allows transformer models to dynamically weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence when encoding or decoding information. By focusing more on relevant tokens and less on others, attention helps capture dependencies regardless of their distance in the sequence, which is crucial for understanding language or visual context."}
{"id": 102, "question": "How can attention be visualized?", "answer": "Attention visualization typically involves heatmaps that show how much at- tention each token gives to others in a sentence. These maps can provide interpretability, revealing patterns like syntax structure or word alignment in translation tasks. Tools like BertViz allow users to explore attention heads and layers visually."}
{"id": 103, "question": "What is the difference between single-head and multi-head atten- tion?", "answer": "Single-head attention computes a single attention score distribution, which might limit its ability to capture diverse relationships. Multi-head attention, on the other hand, uses multiple parallel attention mechanisms, each focusing on different aspects of the input. This enriches the representation and improves model performance. 35 6. Attention Mechanisms and Transformer Internals"}
{"id": 104, "question": "How are queries, keys, and values defined in transformers?", "answer": "Each input token is projected into three vectors: a query vector, a key vec- tor, and a value vector. The attention score between two tokens is computed by taking the dot product of the query from one token and the key from an- other, which is then used to weight the value vectors. This Query-Key-Value mechanism underlies the attention process."}
{"id": 105, "question": "What is the mathematical formula for attention computation?", "answer": "The scaled dot-product attention is defined as: Attention(Q, K, V) =softmax\u0012QKT √dk\u0013 V Here,Q,K, andVare the matrices of queries, keys, and values respectively, andd kis the dimensionality of the keys. The softmax ensures the attention weights sum to one."}
{"id": 106, "question": "Why do we scale attention scores by√dk?", "answer": "Without scaling, the dot products in attention can become large in magni- tude, especially whend kis high. This can push softmax into regions with very small gradients, leading to poor learning. Scaling helps stabilize gradients and improves training."}
{"id": 107, "question": "What are positional encodings and why are they important?", "answer": "Since transformers process tokens in parallel and lack sequential structure, po- sitional encodings provide information about token order. They are added to input embeddings and can be fixed (e.g., sinusoidal) or learned. Without them, the model cannot distinguish between sequences like “cat sat” and “sat cat”."}
{"id": 108, "question": "What is the role of layer normalization in transformers?", "answer": "Layer normalization standardizes the inputs of each sublayer (e.g., attention or feedforward) by centering and scaling. This reduces internal covariate shift, ac- celerates training, and improves model stability, especially in deep architectures like transformers. 36 200 Questions About Transfer Learning and Transformers"}
{"id": 109, "question": "Where is layer normalization applied in transformer blocks?", "answer": "Layer normalization is typically applied before or after each subcomponent within a transformer block—such as attention and feedforward layers. Two common patterns are Pre-LN (used in GPT-2) and Post-LN (used in original transformer), which differ in whether the normalization is applied before or after residual connections."}
{"id": 110, "question": "Why are residual connections used in transformers?", "answer": "Residual connections allow gradients to flow more easily through the network by adding the input of a layer to its output. This helps prevent vanishing gradients and allows for deeper architectures. They also preserve information across layers, enabling better learning of both local and global features."}
{"id": 111, "question": "What is the purpose of dropout in transformers?", "answer": "Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly settingafractionofactivationstozeroduringtraining. Intransformers,dropout is applied after attention weights and in the feedforward layers, encouraging ro- bustness and better generalization."}
{"id": 112, "question": "How does attention differ between encoder and decoder?", "answer": "In the encoder, attention is applied only to the input sequence, allowing the model to learn relationships within the input. In the decoder, self-attention is masked to prevent attending to future tokens, and cross-attention is used to integrate encoder outputs when generating the output sequence."}
{"id": 113, "question": "What is causal attention and why is it used in decoders?", "answer": "Causal (or masked) attention ensures that a token can only attend to previous tokens, not future ones. This is crucial in language generation tasks where predictions must be made sequentially without access to future information, preserving autoregressive behavior."}
{"id": 114, "question": "37 6. Attention Mechanisms and Transformer Internals How many attention heads are typically used in transformers?", "answer": "Standard transformers like BERT-base use 12 attention heads, while larger models like GPT-3 can have hundreds. The number of heads is usually chosen so that the embedding dimension is divisible by the number of heads, balancing computational cost and representational richness."}
{"id": 115, "question": "Can all attention heads be equally important?", "answer": "Not necessarily. Some heads specialize in syntactic relations, while others may capturesemanticrolesorpositionalinformation. Researchhasshownthatsome heads can be pruned with little performance loss, indicating that not all heads contribute equally."}
{"id": 116, "question": "What is attention dropout?", "answer": "Attention dropout is applied to the attention weights before they are used to compute weighted sums of the values. This technique prevents over-reliance on specific tokens and encourages the model to explore multiple attention paths during training."}
{"id": 117, "question": "What happens inside a transformer block?", "answer": "A transformer block typically consists of a multi-head attention layer, followed by a position-wise feedforward network. Each of these sublayers is wrapped with residual connections and layer normalization. This structure is repeated multiple times to form the transformer model."}
{"id": 118, "question": "What is the role of the feedforward network in transformers?", "answer": "The feedforward network (FFN) applies two linear transformations with a non- linearity (usually ReLU or GELU) in between. It operates independently at each position and enhances the model’s capacity to learn complex transforma- tions beyond attention-based dependencies."}
{"id": 119, "question": "Why is softmax used in attention mechanisms?", "answer": "Softmax transforms the raw attention scores into probabilities that sum to one, 38 200 Questions About Transfer Learning and Transformers highlighting important tokens while down-weighting irrelevant ones. It ensures the model learns to focus selectively on parts of the sequence when computing context-aware representations."}
{"id": 120, "question": "How do attention mechanisms contribute to model interpretability?", "answer": "Attention maps can show which parts of the input the model focuses on when making decisions. While not a perfect explanation, they offer insights into model behavior, helping users understand token importance, dependencies, and error sources. 39 6.
